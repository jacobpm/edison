# Intel速 Edison and the IoT Acceleration Starter Kit

## Introduction

The [Intel速 Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html) is a tiny board-computer with a Silvermont dual-core Intel Atom CPU, integrating WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, 1 GB DDR, 4 GB eMMC flash memory and USB controllers. The 40 multiplexed GPIO pins, high computing power and connectivity capabilities allow rapid industrial IoT and fog computing prototyping.

In this repository you will find tutorials and code examples to make use of the Edison as a sensor node with the [IoT Acceleration Starter
Kit](http://www.iot-starterkit.de/), using two languages: Python and Arduino.

This document provides some resources on how to get started with the Edison, including the mechanical assembly. **If your board has already been assembled, then please navigate to one of the available tutorials to continue:**

* [Python](https://github.com/relayr/edison/tree/master/python)
* [Arduino](https://github.com/relayr/edison/tree/master/arduino)

## Requirements

The following hardware is required:

 * [Dell Edge Gateway 5100]()
 * [Intel速 Edison Arduino breakout kit]()

Note: The additional hardware required for the code examples is specified the Arduino and Python tutorials, although everything what's necessary is already included in the [IoT Acceleration Starter Kit](http://www.iot-starterkit.de/).

## Installation & Configuration (WIP!)

### Setting Up the Hardware (WIP!)

Assemble the Arduino Expansion Board found in your Dell Starter Kit according
to the directions in the [Intel速 Edison guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/628221).

Before continuing, make sure that your board looks like this:
