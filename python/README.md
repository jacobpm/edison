# Intel Edison and the Dell Starter Kit (Python edition)

## Introduction

This document details all the necessary steps required
to make use of the 
[Intel Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html)
as a sensor node with
[Dell Starter Kit](http://www.iot-starterkit.de/). This document
refers **only** to using **Python** on the Edison. See
[here](https://github.com/relayr/edison/tree/master/Arduino) for
using Arduino instead.

## Requirements

The following software is required:

 * [Dell gateway]()
 * [Intel Edison Arduino breakout kit]()
 * [Seedstudio base shield]()
 * [Seedstudio sensor kit]()

A computer is required to connect the Edison board to for
flashing and configuring.

## Installation & configuration

### Setting up the hardware

Assemble the Arduino Expansion Board found in your Dell Starter Kit
according to the directions in the
[Intel Edison guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/628221).

### Setting up the firmware

To flash the operating system onto the board, use the
[IntelÂ® Edison Board Configuration Tool](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-edison-osx-step2)
[where are the instructions for Linux/Windoze?]. The official
operating system is provided by the
[Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/), which is a Linux
flavor geared towards embedded systems.

The setup wizard will guide you through the firmware flashing process, SSH
configuration and WiFi configuration. When a step is completed, a green
checkmark is shown next to each of the setup options in the wizard.

### Connecting your personal computer with the Intel Edison

To connect the board to your computer, log in using SSH:

```shell
ssh root@<edison's-IP-address>
```

The Edison's IP address is found in the WiFi section of the **Intel
Edison Board Configuration Tool**. 

Alternatively, we can find the IP address of the board **without** the
Intel configuration wizard by using any of the following methods:

 1. Log in to your router/access point and find the IP address assigned to the Edison board.
 2. Set up [mDNS](http://www.multicastdns.org/) on your Intel Edison.
 3. Set up the board using a **static** IP.
 4. Find the IP address of the board using a scanner such as [`nmap`](https://nmap.org/).

When prompted for a password upon connecting via SSH, 
use the one that was set in the security settings of the Intel Edison Board
Configuration Tool. If everything worked properly, we should now be
logged in to the board as **root**.

### Setting up the `libmraa` library

Once you are connected to Intel Edison and able to interact with its
Linux shell, we can move on and install all of the libraries and Python
packages that you'll need. 

The default firmware (Linux Yocto image)
comes with Python 2.7 already installed, so you can start running
scripts right away. However, if you wish to interact with the GPIOs of
the Intel Edison breakout board, you'll have to install
the [`libmraa`](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) C/C++ library,
which provides bindings for Java, JavaScript and Python. As noted in
the linked Github repository, you can install it through the 
[OPKG package manager](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/opkg) by
executing the following three commands:

```shell
echo 'src mraa-upm http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/3.5/intelgalactic/opkg/i586' > /etc/opkg/mraa-upm.conf
opkg update
opkg install mraa
```

The first line adds the source of the `libmraa` repository to the
package manager source list, and then the second one updates the existing
[opkg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opkg) packages, and then the last one
installs the `libmraa` package.

### Python Dependencies

The next step is to install the Python dependencies. We need to
send messages with the sensor readings to the [Dell gateway](). 

**NOTE:** When dealing with Python dependencies and versions, it is good practice
to create an isolated Python environment for each application we are
running. 

#### Virtualenv

`virtualenv` is a tool for creating and managing isolated Python
environments. It's installed using the `pip` Python package
manager.

```shell
pip install virtualenv
```
Once it's installed, we can now create an isolated environment wherever we
want:

```shell
virtualenv --system-site-packages <ENV>
```

where `<ENV>` is the name of the directory where the new virtual
environment exists. The `--system-site-packages` switch is for
inheriting all the packages in the global site-packages directory (in
this case the `libmraa` package).

To activate the environment, run:

```shell
source bin/activate
```

You will notice the `(<ENV>)` prefix appearing in your command-line
interface, which indicates that you are in an isolated Python
environment called `<ENV>`.

Now we can use `pip` package manager and the Python interpreter just as we
normally would. However, additional Python packages will be installed **only**
in the virtual environment

To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

```
shell deactivate
``` 

If you encounter any issues when using `virtualenv`, consult the [official
documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

####Paho MQTT

In order to run the Python examples provided in this repository, we need to
install the [`paho-mqtt`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1) package,
which provides an MQTT client library and enables sending/receiving of
messages to/from an MQTT broker. [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) is
a lightweight messaging protocol built on top of TCP/IP. We chose it because
of its simplicity and low overhead.

To install `paho-mqtt`  with `pip`, run:

```shell
pip install paho-mqtt
```

Once it's installed, we can now use `paho-mqtt` classes by importing the
module into our script:

```python
import paho-mqtt
```

To learn more about the functionalities of the
`paho-mqtt` Python client, see the
[official documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1).

After finishing all installation and configuration steps, we are now 
ready to make use of MQTT and run the code examples below.
